<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was a project i made for educational purposes only.

The Echidna launcher, is a python based Malware builder and obfuscator. I build this to troll some friends, and just have some fun. It is made to run on windows pc's, but the builder might work on other systems as well, tho i havent tested it. This is an outdated version of the launcher and i dont know if i will be working on it again. Some of the code might be working, but i dont have the time to work on this at the moment.

Features:
* Discord token stealer
* Ping to web api
* send commands and run scripts from the cloud
* preloaded scripts to do stuff

This was again made for educational purposes only, and i am not liable for any actions one might take with this code.
